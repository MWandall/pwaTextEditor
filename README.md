# pwaTextEditor


## Description


- I wanted to create a web application that can be downloaded and can create notes and code snippets online or offline.
- I wanted to expand my knowledge of progressive web applications and get familiar with webpack and service workers.
- This solves the problem of being limited to having internet access for the entire experience of the application.
- I learned how useful PWAs can be as well as how to trouble shoot persisting data in the browser using dev tools.

## Installation

From the base code, npm install, npm run build, then npm run start or start:dev depending on needs. From the live site, click the install button to have the app locally. 

## Usage

This text editor can be used for plain text or code snippets with syntax highlighting. Internet is needed for initial load, then offline capabilities are available. Text written offline will need an internet connection to update elsewhere in the browser.
